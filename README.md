# Convolution-Neural-Network
This repository runs a CNN model, on top of which it compares between a simple CNN model and a transfer learning based model. Here we have used VGG-16 as our transfer learning model.

You can watch the detailed analysis of the model functionality on- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5DvyxADDU&t=14s&ab_channel=IvyProSchool
